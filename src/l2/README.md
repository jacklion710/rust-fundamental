# Fundamental Rust Concepts: A Deep Dive

Welcome to the second lesson in our Rust basics series, where we delve into the core concepts that make Rust a unique and powerful language for system programming. This lesson covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, data types, functions, and control flow in Rust.

## Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes

Rust's approach to memory safety is built around the concepts of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which together ensure that memory is managed efficiently without the need for a garbage collector.

### Ownership

In Rust, each value has a variable that's called its *owner*. There can only be one owner at a time, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped. This is helpful for ensuring memory is managed and not copied unneccesarily

```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, Rust!");
let s2 = s1;
println!("{}", s2);
```

In this example, `s1` is no longer valid after its ownership is moved to `s2`.

## Borrowing

Rust allows references to a value without taking ownership, called borrowing. This is useful when you want to access data without taking ownership of it.

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

Here's why borrowing is used in this scenario:

* Efficiency: Borrowing a String as an immutable reference (`&String`) allows the function to read the length of the string without needing to take ownership and make a potentially expensive copy of the string data. This is especially important for large strings or in performance-critical code paths.

* Functionality: The function only needs to read the length of the string, not alter it. Using a reference ensures that the original string remains unchanged, and it can still be used after the function call.

* Safety and Concurrency: By borrowing the string immutably, Rust guarantees at compile time that no other part of the code can mutate the string while it's borrowed. This eliminates a whole class of bugs and race conditions related to concurrent access and mutation.

## Lifetimes

Lifetimes are Rust's way of ensuring that references are valid for the duration they are used. It prevents dangling references.

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}
```

`<'a>`: This part declares a lifetime parameter named `'a`. Lifetime parameters are named using a single quote followed by any identifier (similar to generic type parameters). The `'a` lifetime parameter signifies that all the references in the arguments and the return value must have at least this lifetime.

`x: &'a str, y: &'a str`: Both `x` and `y` are references to strings (`str`) that must be valid for the lifetime `'a`. This means `x` and `y` must live at least as long as `'a`.

`-> &'a str`: The function returns a reference to a string (`str`) that will also be valid for the lifetime `'a`. This ensures that the returned reference is not dangling; it's guaranteed to be as valid as the inputs.

## Data Types in Rust

Rust offers various data types, including scalar types like integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters, as well as compound types like tuples and arrays.

### Scalar Types

```rust
let int_example: i32 = 100;
let float_example: f64 = 3.14;
let bool_example: bool = true;
let char_example: char = 'R';
```

### Compound Types

```rust
let tuple_example: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let array_example: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
```

## Functions and Control Flow

Functions in Rust are declared with the `fn` keyword, and their parameters and return values must have types specified.

### Functions

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

### Control Flow

Rust uses `if`, `else`, and loops (`loop`, `while`, `for`) to control the flow of execution.

```rust
let number = 7;
if number < 5 {
    println!("condition was true");
} else {
    println!("condition was false");
}
```

## Putting It All Together

We've covered the foundational concepts of Rust that are crucial for understanding the language's approach to safety and efficiency. The provided examples demonstrate how Rust's ownership, data types, functions, and control flow work together to create safe and efficient programs.
