# Rust Fundamentals: An 8-Part Lesson Plan

Welcome to the Rust Fundamentals course, a comprehensive guide designed to take you from Rust newbie to proficient Rustacean. This 8-part series covers everything from the basics of Rust programming to advanced topics like concurrency and Rust's ecosystem and tooling.

## Course Structure

The course is structured into 8 lessons, each focusing on key aspects of the Rust programming language. Lessons are contained within their own directories under `src`, making it easy to navigate and focus on specific topics:

- **Lesson 1**: Getting Started with Rust
- **Lesson 2**: Fundamental Rust Concepts
- **Lesson 3**: Structs, Enums, and Pattern Matching
- **Lesson 4**: Rust Memory Management
- **Lesson 5**: Error Handling in Rust
- **Lesson 6**: Collections and Generics
- **Lesson 7**: Advanced Topics: Traits and Lifetimes
- **Lesson 8**: Concurrency in Rust
- **Conclusion**: Wrapping up and Next Steps

Each lesson directory contains a `README.md` for an overview and detailed explanations, alongside `.rs` files demonstrating key concepts and code examples.

## Setup and Installation

To get started, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. Follow the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to set up Rust and Cargo.

Once Rust is installed, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url/rust-fundamentals.git
cd rust-fundamentals
```

## Running Lessons

Each lesson can be run individually to see the concepts in action. Navigate to the root of the project and use Cargo to run the desired lesson. For example, to run Lesson 1:

```bash
cargo run --bin lesson1

# or

cargo run lesson1
```

Replace `lesson1` with the appropriate lesson identifier to run different parts of the course.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured layout to organize lessons and related content:

* **Cargo.toml:** The Cargo configuration file defining project metadata and dependencies.
* **src/:** Source directory containing lesson modules and Rust code.
    * **l1, l2, ...x, l8/:** Individual lesson directories.
    * **main.rs:** Entry point that can be used to integrate and run lesson examples.
* **target/:** The directory where Cargo compiles and stores binaries and other artifacts.
* **README.md:** The main README file providing an overview and instructions for the course.

Each lesson is designed to build on the previous ones, gradually increasing in complexity and introducing more advanced Rust features. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of Rust's core principles, memory safety guarantees, and concurrency model, equipping you with the knowledge to start building your own Rust applications.
